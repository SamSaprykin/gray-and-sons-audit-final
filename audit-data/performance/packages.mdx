- [ ] Self hosted strapi plugin

Greg, I have a question related to self hosted strapi plugin. Do you think it's not outdated? Can we update it with latest version of plugin?

- [ ] Packages version

As I gather, some packages are outdated and require Node.js version 16.x.x, but this version will become unstable soon (February 2024). I would recommend removing unnecessary packages and update the remaining ones to more stable versions.
