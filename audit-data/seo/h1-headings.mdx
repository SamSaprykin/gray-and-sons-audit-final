- [x] **Dennis** Product Page, H1 Heading

The current H1 heading is as follows:

`H1 RolexDaytona / Ref. 11650940mm, White Gold`

Solution
It is necessary to make the H1 heading as follows:

That is, add spaces. Since these are keywords, if written concatenated, these are errors and affect ranking.
Ref. 11650940mm and Ref. 116509 40mm are also different keywords that affect ranking.

![heading-issue](/seo/heading-issue.png)

Solution

1. H1-h2-h3 headings - important for SEO optimization.
2. H1 heading - should be 1 on the page and should contain an important keyword that the page should rank for.
3. H2-H3 headings are headings that should contain keywords that relate to the H1 heading and the page topic.
4. All headings should not contain paragraphs of text.
5. Headings h4-h5-h6 can be used for block titles or technical texts, but should not be used in bulk.
6. On all pages of the site it is recommended to observe the following structure of headings

- [x] **Dennis** H headings in the footer

Description

The current structure of H headings in the footer is as follows:

<pre>
  H2 Our company H3 About Us H3 Our Story H3 Fan Club H3 Our Reviews H3 Refer a
  Friend H2 Our Services H3 Shop H3 Sell to Us H3 Repairs H3 Catalog Request H3
  Blogs H2 Customer Service H3 Warranty H3 Affirm Financing H3 Shipping Rates H3
  FAQ H3 Glossary H2 Contact Us FacebookInstagramYoutube H3 9595 Harding Avenue
  Miami Beach, FL 33154 +1.800.918.2608 info@grayandsons.com
</pre>

Solution

a) I would recommend using H4 headings for "Our company", "Our Services", "Customer Service", "Contact Us".

b) Note the heading `<h2> Contact Us FacebookInstagramYoutube </h2>`, it should be the following `<h4> Contact Us </h4>`. We have to remove the following text " FacebookInstagramYoutube".
